# pk_fight_engine

# This marker is the engine that manage a "fight". When a player approches a fight trigger, it will trigger the fight engine.
# This last one will run different events depending on the step of the fight (see "Hooks").
# On "Start", the engine will summon the Entities and Reinforcing Entities
# At this moment, it will start if at least a single mob matching its TriggerValue is still existing. If not, it means the players defeated them all.
# If not, the "Resolve" step is triggered, the fight_engine and its relative fight_trigger diseappear.
# If yes but resetable, and if there's no alive player near the fight engine anymore, it will be reset.
